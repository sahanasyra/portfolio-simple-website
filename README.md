- **Contact Page:** A page with a form that allows visitors to reach out to me, along with my contact details.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Simple Navigation:** Easy-to-use navigation between the home and contact pages.
- **Clean Layout:** A minimalist layout that focuses on content and readability.
